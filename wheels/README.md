# Pre-built Python Wheels

This directory contains pre-built Python wheel files for arm7hf architecture that can be directly downloaded and installed on OT-2 systems.

## Quick Installation

Download and install directly:

```bash
# Example: Install prefect
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sgbaird/opentrons-python-packages/main/wheels/prefect-3.3.4-py3-none-any.whl -o /tmp/prefect.whl
pip install /tmp/prefect.whl

# Example: Install pandas
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sgbaird/opentrons-python-packages/main/wheels/pandas-1.5.0-cp310-cp310-linux_armv7l.whl -o /tmp/pandas.whl
pip install /tmp/pandas.whl
```

## Available Packages

- `pandas-1.5.0-cp310-cp310-linux_armv7l.whl` - Pandas data analysis library (compiled for arm7hf)
- `prefect-3.3.4-py3-none-any.whl.placeholder` - Prefect wheel (will be generated by CI)

Note: Some wheels are placeholders and will be replaced by actual built wheels when CI runs successfully.

## Purpose

These wheels are provided as a backup when CI-built artifacts are not available or accessible. They are built using the same cross-compilation process as the automated CI system.

## Updating

Wheels in this directory are updated when:
1. New package versions are added
2. CI builds complete successfully and produce new wheels
3. Manual updates are needed for critical fixes

Last updated: Simplified CI implementation
Built from: Current commit with consolidated CI workflows
