# opentrons-python-packages
A repository hosting prebuilds of Python packages suitable for installing on an Opentrons robot.

**This repository is under construction and the code here has not yet been released.**

The OT-2 uses a custom Buildroot-created Linux system running on a Raspberry Pi. Because it is a custom system, it cannot use binary python packages made with Raspbian in mind; because it is an arm7hf architecture, it cannot use more general manylinux wheels made with x86-64 or arm64 in mind. Since the OT-2 itself does not have a compiler, we use this repository to provide prebuilt python wheels that are installable on an OT-2 by using a [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503) simple package index.

Any package identified here can be installed on an OT-2 through `pip`.

## Quick Installation

### Option 1: One-line installer
```bash
# Install pandas
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sgbaird/opentrons-python-packages/main/install.sh | bash -s -- pandas
```

### Option 2: Manual download
For immediate use, pre-built wheel files are available in the [wheels/](wheels/) directory:

```bash
# Install pandas directly from repository  
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sgbaird/opentrons-python-packages/main/wheels/pandas-1.5.0-cp310-cp310-linux_armv7l.whl -o /tmp/pandas.whl
pip install /tmp/pandas.whl
```

### Option 3: CI Artifacts
Download wheel files from the latest [GitHub Actions artifacts](../../actions) or [releases](../../releases).

## Requesting Packages

Please open an issue if there is a Python package that you want that is not present, or if there is a specific version of a Python package that the index does not have. Please also feel free to open a pull request to add it! Before requesting a package or new version, please try installing it on an OT-2 first; only packages with native code components need to be here, since pure-python packages are installable from PyPI.

Be aware that the OT-2 system can't always handle the addition of a specific package. For instance, the package might be a thin wrapper around a system library that is not available on the OT-2; or it might have a toolchain that does not allow cross-compilation with the tools we have available.

## Building, and Dependencies To Build

This repo is intended to work in production on github CI, but you can test builds locally (and should, since some packages can have surprising build system requirements). The entry point for building is `./build-packages`. It's a python script that should work on anything above python 3.7. You can get usage by running `./build-packages --help`.

You'll also need to have Docker installed and running and accessible with how you call `./build-packages` (i.e., if you don't want to use `sudo` then the docker socket should be user-accessible).

### Machine Compatibility for Building

This is tested and maintained for x64 docker. It should work if you run it from
- An x86_64 linux host
  - Including WSL
- An x86_64 OSX host

It might work on a native Windows x86_64 host.

It definitely will not work on any machine architecture that presents the docker container with an arm64 environment (e.g. M1/M2 macs, phones, embedded devices). The buildroot SDK that powers the package builds needs to run in an x86_64 architecture. If that's all you have, you'll have to run it in a cross-architecture vm.

## Build Tools

The build tools are a separate package that is developed in this repo in `./tools` - see that directory for more.

## Adding a New Package

To add a package to the repo, make a new set of directories in the `package/` directory for it. A best practice is to make that directory named `package_name/version` - for instance, `package/pandas/1.5.0`. For instance, if you wanted to add another version of pandas, you could add `package/pandas/2.0.0`.

In that directory, make a python script called `build.py`.  Its job is to call `build.build_package` with correct arguments. A good example is `package/pandas/1.5.0/build.py`. `build.build_package` lives in `tools/builder/package_build/orchestrate.py` if you want to look at the source. 

The `source` argument takes an object describing where to get the package. There is a helper function to build it: `builder.package_build.github_source`, which lets you specify
- the github org (i.e. `pandas-dev` for pandas)
- the github repo (i.e. `pandas` for pandas)
- a git tag to find
- some other options about how the package is distributed and what kind of source it is. Check out `tools/builder/package_build/__init__.py` to see more.

Then, you set the `setup_commands` (typically these will be `build_ext` and `bdist_wheel`, but it depends on the package) and any build dependencies. Build dependencies are probably listed in the package metadata; they may be there as `setup_depends` or pyproject toml build system requirements. They may also just be assumed to be present. You can figure out what's required by reading the package code, or by trying to build it in an empty venv.

Finally, try a build with `./build-packages`.

## How does this all work, anyway?
